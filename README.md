Spot the Swallows site build.

This site was developed to be an extension to the Pt. Defiance Zoo and Aquarium website. The intent is to provide more information about the Purple Martin Conservation effort that the zoo supports through their Spot the Swallows program. Every year the zoo enlists and trains volunteers to become Citizen Scientists to observe and record Purple Martin populations at various nesting locations around the Puget Sound area. Currently the zoo website devotes a small section of one page to the Spot the Swallows program.

The purpose of this project is to create a site that will provide more information about the Spot the Swallows conservation effort, and also provide a means to digitize the observation data. Currently observers visit the nest site and fill out their observation data on a paper form. They then scan that form in some way and email that file to a zoo representative. This site has a data collection form for each nest site and will allow the Citizen Scientist to record an observation per the following example:

The Citizen Scientist observes a female Purple Martin land on the nest box labeled 10. The female is seen feeding a nestling.

On the form the Citizen Scientist would select:
female
box 10
landed
food carrying
nestling observed
they would then click: Submit

The observation would then be recorded as row in a data table with the observer name, date and time appended to the rest of the data.
Currently that data is stored into local storage on each Citizen Scientist's PC. To share that data with the zoo the Citizen Scientist would need to copy the text of the table from their browser and then paste that into an email to then send to the zoo representative.

Further Development: The goal of further development is to have the observation data be automatically shared to a central repository that can be accessed by the Zoo and other Citizen Scientist and have the data represented by an appropriate Chart, or in raw form.
